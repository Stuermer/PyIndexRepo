# Fast Refractive Index

This package gives access to the refractive index data from [RefractiveIndex.info]().

The focus of this package is to provide a convenient interface to the refractive index data, and be
efficient in the calculation.

## How to use it

#### Basics

```python
from refractiveindex.fri import RefractiveIndexLibrary

db = RefractiveIndexLibrary(auto_upgrade=True)
bk7 = db.search_material_by_page_name('N-BK7')[0]  # returns a list of different BK7 glasses
print(bk7.get_n(0.5875618))
```

When executed for the first time, the database from the
RefractiveIndex [Github Repo](https://github.com/polyanskiy/refractiveindex.info-database) will be downloaded and
converted to a python object. This process takes a few minutes. Consecutive calls will load the database object
from a local file (almost immediately).

Auto-upgrade of the library is supported, but switched off by default.

There are two main classes that allow interacting with the data: the RefractiveIndexLibrary class
and the Material class.

#### Temperature data

When temperature data is available, the refractive index of a material can be queried at any temperature
within the valid temperature range:

```python
import numpy as np
from refractiveindex.fri import RefractiveIndexLibrary

db = RefractiveIndexLibrary(auto_upgrade=True)
bk7 = db.search_material_by_page_name('N-BK7')[0]  # returns a list of different BK7 glasses
wl = np.linspace(0.4, 0.7, 10000)
print(bk7.get_n_at_temperature(wl, temperature=30))
```

``` 
[1.53088657 1.53088257 1.53087857 ... 1.51309187 1.51309107 1.51309027]
```
